                    Background
                    Quantitative risk assessment is a fundamental action to ensure safe operation of critical high-tech systems. The increased constraints imposed by international standards together with the ever-growing penetration of AI components in high-tech systems make rigorous and powerful risk assessment more important than ever. Various techniques have been developed throughout the years to analyze the safety and reliability of systems. One of the most relevant is Fault Tree Analysis (FTA). Every day, millions of engineers are using fault trees to model their systems and analyze the probability of failures. FTA is applied to many safety-critical systems and their use is required for instance by the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) USA, in ISO 26262 for autonomous driving or for software development in aerospace systems (by NASA and ESA). While fault trees are easy to understand and thus, widely used, their modelling capabilities are severely limited. This lack of flexibility hinders accurate and precise modelling of real-life systems e.g., self-driving cars, hyperloops and drones.. To overcome these drawbacks, several extensions of fault trees have been proposed in the last decades. Dynamic fault trees (DFT) are a prominent extension of fault trees overcoming these limitations. DFTs have been co-developed by NASA Formal Methods group to model more complex behaviors and dependability patterns. While fault tree models represent how failures occur at system component level and how they propagate through sub-systems, eventually leading to system level failures, their analysis focuses on computing various dependability metrics, i.e. key performance indicators that measure how well a system performs. Standard metrics are the system reliability (i.e. the probability that no failure occurred until time T), the availability (i.e. the average percentage of time that a system is operational), the mean time to failure, the mean time between failures, the criticality of components (i.e. to what extent does a component failure contribute to a system failure) etc. Various extensions include the cost and impact of failures.
